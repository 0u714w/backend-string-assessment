# Strings
For this assessment, the comments within each file will explain how to
complete each function.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

be able to figure it out as you go.

[string1.py](./string1.py) -- Complete the string functions in string1.py,
based on your knowledge of Python strings, indexing, slicing, and methods.

[string2.py](./string2.py) -- Additional string function completions.
